# Dictionary in Python

## Introduction
This is an offline dictionary based on a JSON-based database. The purpose of creating this dictionary was to practice my skills of Python as I learn it. 

## How it works
The application works in the following way:
* Application asks the user to enter a word
* User enters a word
* Application displays the definition(s) of the word
* If no matching word(s) are found, application checks for similar words and displays the list of words (if found)
* User enters the serial number of similar word or the word itself
* Application displays the definitions of the word
  
## Application Functionality
This application does the following:
* Displays the definitions of a word
* Keeps asking the user for another words until the user types ':exit'
